## Q&A

### What does enumrated mean? Why is it important?

It means it's a power given to the federal government explicitly. For example, the constitution specifically states that congress can regulate commerce.

But the constitution doesn't say that congress can regulate airlines. But it does say that congress can regulate commerce, and because airlines are commerce, they can regulate airlines, even if it's not explicitly stated. So the ability to regulate airlines is an implied power, while the ability to regulate commerce is an enumerated power.

### Are there still issues with the constitution?

Pretty much everyone will say yes. But they'll all disagree on what the problems are, it's subjective.
