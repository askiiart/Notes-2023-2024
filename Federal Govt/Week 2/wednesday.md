## Importance of constitutions

"Every word of the Constitution decides a question between liberty and power." - James Madison

- The social contract between the people and the govt.

## Mercantilism

- Colonies exist to enrich the mother country
- Anything coming out of the colonies goes to the colonizer, in this case Britain, and then they sell it and make lots of profit.

## Taxes

- Sugar and Stamp Acts
  - Tax on sugar and stamps
  - Got repealed, was replaced with other taxes.
- Boston Tea Party
  - Colonists dressed up as Native Americans and dumped tea into the Boston Harbor.
- The King doubled down on everything, so in 1775 the colonists finally got fed up. There were some skirmishes, and then the Continental Congress created a militia, and the Revolutionary War started.

## Life, Liberty, and...

The original (by John Locke) was "life, liberty, and property", but it was changed to "life, libery, and the pursuit of happiness" because the Founding Fathers didn't want it to be about property.

## Systems of govt

- Unitary
  - One central govt
  - Too powerful
  - Not necesarily autocracy, just a "federal-only" government. Very little local power.
- Confederal
  - Loose alliance of states
  - This is what the US was under the **Articles of Confederation**, but it was too weak.
    - The states had too much power, and the central govt had too little.
    - The states were basically their own countries (that's why they're called "states", and not "provinces" or "counties" or something like that).
    - The central govt couldn't tax, so it couldn't pay for anything. And they had *a lot* of debt.
      - **Big problem**: Required all 13 states to agree to change *anything*.

## Constitutional Convention

- They make the constitution.
- Called to "revise" the Articles of Confederation, but they ended up making a whole new document.
- Was originally supposed to be public, decided to do it in secrecy once they actually got there.
- Principles:
  - Derives power from people
  - BUT not too much power, in order to prevent tyranny of the majority (AKA the farmers and poor people)

### Virginia Plan

- 3 branches of government
  - Executive, legislative, and judicial
- Bicameral legislature
  - 2 houses
  - Lower house apportioned by population
  - All states equal in upper house
- Supremacy clause
  - If there's a conflict between state and federal law, federal law wins
- **Federal** system (federalism)

### New Jersey Plan

- Equal representation for all states, unicameral legislature
  - Can tax and regulate commerce
- Plural executive, but they cannot veto
  - Does *not* mean 2 equal presidents
  - Lots of different executive leaders for different things
- Supreme court

## Summary

- Mercantilism: The economics of colonialism, basically. Colonies enrich the mother country.
- Taxes: Colonists got mad about taxes, so they rebelled. KIng doubled down, so they started the Revolutionary War.
- Systems of govt: Unitary is central power, confederal is state power. The US was confederal under the Articles of Confederation, but it was too weak, and switched to federalism (via the Constitution through the Virginia Plan).
