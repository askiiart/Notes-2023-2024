# Loops

## While loops

Format:

```java
while (condition) {
    // code
}
```

This runs until condition is false.

## Do-while loops

Format:

```java
do {
    // code
} while (condition);
```

This always runs once, then runs until condition is false.

## For loops

Format:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code
}
```

You can actually do anything in those spots, the only thing that matters is:

1. The first part is run once at the beginning
2. The second part is checked before each iteration
3. The third part is run after each iteration
