## Salvation by Langston Hughes

- Langston goes into the salvation meeting with the expectation that he will literally see Jesus.
  - Stuff was never explained to him, he just knew his aunt "saw Jesus", and stuff like that.
- He doesn't see Jesus, and he feels like he's done something wrong. He feels very guilty.
- He lies and says he sees Jesus, and he feels even more guilty.
- Because Jesus didn't come to him, he feels like he's not saved, and no longer believed in Jesus.

Also, they called the kids "lambs", implying that the parents were "sheep". They implicitly called the followers of their religion sheep. Though I understand that the connotations have changed over thousands over years - it's supposed to be like "you're a lost lamb until you're shepherded by Jesus", but still, it doesn't seem great if you want to *not* look like a cult.
